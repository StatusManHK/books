## Introduction

Thomas Hobbes was a famous British poltical theorist and philospher. He believed in mechanistic materialism. Politically, he had a stromg influence on future thinkers, such as Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau. <br>
<br>
This book was published in 1651, and as considered the first work that discussed the doctrine of the state in modern tiems. It had a profound influence on Western liberalism. <br>
<br>
The author believes that human nature and desires are changable, and natural resources are scarce, unable to satify our insaitable desires. So, in a state of nature (that is, a state of anarchism), there would be a war of all people against all people, and everyone is at risk of being killed. <br>
<br>
Then, the writer pointed out the biggest evil is the fear of dying of violence at any time. A political community is established on this fear, and peace is achieved via a certain social contract between the people. <br>
<br>
In terms of the governmental system, the writer believes that no matter where there is a monarchy, aristocracy or democracy, it must be an absolute authority and the law is used to ensure the social contract is implemented.
