## Introduction

Edmund Burke was a thinker, philosopher and author of the 18th century. He used to be a MP of the House of Commons as a member of the Whig Party. He is widely regarded as the founder of modern conservatism. Economically, he supported free trade and the free market, and opposed government intervention. <br>
<br>
This book is the masterpiece of this writer, formed by letters between the writer and other people. <br>
<br>
Not long after the storming of the Bastille in late 1789, a member of the French nobility asked Edmund Burke for his views towards the Revolution. Burke responded in a letter, which was subsequently published in 1790 and recevied widespread popularity. A few years later, a new version was published, with additional letters between Burke and others.
<br>
In the letters, the writer strongly criticised how the French Revolution entirely subverted tradition and entirely damaged social order. He also detailed the basic principles of modern conservatism. <br>
<br>
For that time, he might be one of the very few that supported the American Revolution, but opposed the French Revolution. As evident from the course of such revolutions, Burke's prediction on both were accurate. <br>
