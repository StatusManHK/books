## Introduction

Karl Wittfogel is a German historian and sinologist of Jewish descent. In his early years, he joined the Communist Party of Germany and was a member of the central committee. After the Nazis rose to power, he was put into a concentration camp in 1933, and eventually fled to the United States, gaining US citizenship in 1939. Due to the formation of an alliance between Hitler and Stalin ([Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact)), he reconsidered the communist movement, gradually turning anti-communist. <br>
<br>
The writer participated in communist movements for a long time, and had great understanding of Marxism and Leninism. He frequently quoted their work in this book, which is rather unusual for an anti-communist book. For example, when discussing 'water governance society' (治水社會), he quoted Karl Marx's idea of 'Asian production'(亞細亞生產方式). The writer believes that this form of 'production method' meant that China (or similar countries) did not, and will not, experience feudalism like Wetern Europe. He stated that 'water governance soceities' like China will always be in some state of social stagnation, and could not evolve into a capitalist society. <br>
<br>
Another point of note is that in addition to quoting him, he also made his own observations upon Marx's core ideas. For instance, when comparing China and Western Europe, he stated a key difference: property rights mattered a lot in Western Europe, but not in China. The writer stated that a 'water governance society' would end up forming a powerful central government (中央集權政府), and therefore, property rights are not important. Comparatively, the individual's position in society is more important. <br>
<br>
Based on the above analysis, Karl Wittfogel believes that Karl Marx using property to determine social class (社會階級) simply does not apply in China. He stated that there is no possibility for social reform via class struggle in China, unlike the predictions of Karl Marx. The writer stated that despite intense relations between the people and the government towards the end of Chinese dynasties, it merely causes the change to another dynasty (朝代更替), and does not bring change to social strcuture. <br>
<br>
Considering the significance of this book internationally, the Chinese government created a specailised group in the 1990s and organised two meetings in 1990 and 1994, to rebute the statements of this book from a rational perspective. After two seminars, a book was published that summarised the rebuttals of several Chinese scholars; however, these rebuttals were mostly on the level of whether China is a 'water governance society'. Regarding other points raised by this book, including 'Asian production', 'stagnation of social development' or systems of power, there were almost no rebuttals towards them.
