## About the Author

George Orwell is a left-wing British writer, journalist and critic. <br>
<br>
Born Eric Arthur Blair, he published articles under the name 'George Orwell' since 1933. In his early years, he believed in Marxism-Leninism (communism), and joined the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War) along with the [International Brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brigades) During the Civil War, he encountered factional conflicts within the International Brigade. He was categorised as a Trotskyist and fascist. <br>
<br>
After that, he began reflecting on the communist system, and ended up writing essays and articles that criticised [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism) and [totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism) in general. <br>
<br>
In *Why I Write*, an essay detailing his decision of being a writer, he wrote about the Spanish Civil War, stating:
> The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.

## Introduction

Nineteen Eighty-Four is George Orwell's masterpiece. While it may seem like a science fiction novel to the uninitiated, it is a unforgetting political novel that transcends time. <br>
<br>
This book is among the top of all books that discuss dystopian systems. It is indisputably one of the best political novels of the 20th century. <br>
<br>
This book describes the totalitarianism caused by the communist movement. For example, the totalitarian Oceania uses 'Newspeak' (a controlled language to limit one's ability to think and communicate freely) and 'Doublethink' (indoctrination in which one accepts two conflicting beliefes as truth, at odds with their own memory or sense of reality). This form of thought control is the epitome of brainwashing and indoctrination. <br>
